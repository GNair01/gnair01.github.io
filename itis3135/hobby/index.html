            <h2>What is Tennis?</h2>
            <p>Tennis is a racket sport played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Players use a stringed racket to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over a net into the opponent's court. The objective is to play the ball in such a way that the opponent cannot return it successfully.</p>
            
            <div class="content-box">
                <p>Tennis originated in Birmingham, England, in the late 19th century as lawn tennis. It has roots in the ancient game of real tennis, which was played indoors. Today, tennis is played at all levels of society and at all ages. The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket, including wheelchair users.</p>
                <p>The modern game involves a variety of shots including serves, forehands, backhands, volleys, and smashes. Professional tennis is played on various surfaces including grass, clay, and hard courts, each offering unique playing characteristics that affect ball speed and player movement.</p>
